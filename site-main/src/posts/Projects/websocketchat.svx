(Production-ready deployment with SSL, CORS, and encrypted WebSocket support)

# ðŸš€ Real-Time Encrypted Chat Application
## ðŸ§© Project Summary

A real-time, full-stack chat application designed for secure communication between users, featuring end-to-end RSA encryption, private messaging, live public chatrooms, and an integrated AI chatbot. Built with modern web standards and a strong focus on security, the system includes JWT-based authentication, responsive UI, and production-ready deployment practices like HTTPS, CORS policies, and WebSocket connection management.

## ðŸ›  Notable Technologies Used

1. **FastAPI** â€“ Python web framework for API and WebSocket handling  
2. **WebSockets** â€“ Real-time messaging for public and private chat  
3. **RSA Encryption** â€“ End-to-end encrypted private messaging  
4. **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** â€“ Secure user authentication  
5. **bcrypt** â€“ Password hashing for secure login  
6. **SQLAlchemy + SQLite** â€“ ORM and lightweight database layer  
7. **Pydantic** â€“ Typed request/response validation  
8. **Vanilla JavaScript** â€“ Lightweight frontend without frameworks  
9. **CSS3** â€“ Animations and glassmorphism-style UI  
10. **Nginx + Certbot (SSL)** â€“ Secure deployment with HTTPS and reverse proxy



## ðŸ“ˆ What This Project Shows

Experience building **full-stack** applications from API to UI  
Deep understanding of **secure real-time communication** using WebSockets and encryption  
Commitment to **code quality**: typed, modular, and well-documented  
Awareness of **production constraints** like SSL, CORS, and deployment setup
