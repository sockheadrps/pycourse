# Building Software Systems

To effectively build software systems, we need to understand how code is organized and structured. Let's start with a fundamental question:

## What Makes Good Software?

At its core, good software solves real problems efficiently and reliably. Whether it's a mobile app, web service, or embedded system, well-designed software should be both powerful and maintainable. While technical skills are important, successful software development requires understanding core principles of system design and organization.

The key to building maintainable software systems lies in proper **abstraction**.

## Understanding Abstraction

An **abstraction** is a simplified model that captures the essential aspects of a complex system while hiding unnecessary details. Good abstractions allow developers to reason about and work with complicated systems by focusing on relevant high-level concepts.

The main components of an abstraction are:

- **Interfaces**: The defined ways to interact with the system
- **State**: The internal data and configuration that the system maintains
- **Behaviors**: The operations and transformations the system can perform

These components work together to create a cohesive model that other parts of the system can rely on.

## A Real-World Example

Let's look at how abstraction works in practice by modeling a **smart thermostat** system:

A smart thermostat needs to maintain temperature, respond to schedules, and optimize for energy efficiency. Here's how we might represent its core functionality:
