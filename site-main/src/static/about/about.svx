Hey friends! 👋

# Another “learn to code” site?

I got tired of seeing learning resources that bury beginners in overly cute or convoluted storylines and half-explained concepts. 
Many tutorials try to pad out simple ideas with fairy-tale backstories, but they often do more harm than good. I wanted a resource 
that explains coding topics clearly and directly—no fluff or baby talk.  

This site is my attempt at delivering accurate, plainspoken tutorials. I believe you’re smart enough to follow a direct explanation without needless metaphors 
or hand-holding. Let’s cut through the noise and learn coding in a straightforward way!
